# [Tic tac toe four](https://ttt-four.vercel.app/)

This is a strategic twist on the classic tic-tac-toe game. It starts off familiar, but after four moves, the game dynamic shifts. Each player can only have at most four pieces on the board. On the fourth move of each player, if the player placed and did not win, the last piece placed by the player will be tactically removed from the board, adding a new level of strategy to the game.

With this new version, the game never ends in a draw. It's a thrilling battle, always concluding in a win or a loss, adding an extra layer of excitement to each move and keeping you on the edge of your seat.

> "As for the inspiration, one day, I was scrolling through the Instagram reels, and I saw a video of a person playing this version of tic-tac-toe. It was an excellent idea, and I was immediately drawn to it. I decided to bring it to life by creating a web version. I hope you enjoy playing it as much as I enjoyed making it.

## The thoughts behind the game

- The goal is to create a fun and challenging game that is easy to understand and play.
- The game should be aesthetically pleasing.
- It should be easy to play on a mobile device.
- It should contain animations and other micro-interactions to make the game more engaging. (I've used framer, rough-notation, and confetti for this purpose)
- The UI must be clean and purposeful.
- Remember the 404 page.
- The game should have to be keyboard accessible.

# Tech stack

It's a simple game that uses Next.js and Tailwind CSS. The game logic is written in TypeScript. It is hosted on Vercel.

# Future plans

The game is not heavily optimized for performance. I plan to optimize it for better performance, add a feature to play with a friend online and add a feature to play with a bot. Finally, improve the confetti animation.
